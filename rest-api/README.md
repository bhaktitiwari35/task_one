# Introduction and Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to help the reader understand a method to quickly create a REST API, and to understand the process of creating an API starting first with the API definintion.  We will use the Swagger definition language (aka the [OpenAPI Specification](http://swagger.io/specification/)) in this tutorial.

# Step 0: Installing Prerequisites

We're going to use the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) environment to build our project.  However, we're not going to build the application from scratch, but instead use a few frameworks to speed up the process.  Frameworks are common in application development to remove a lot of the boilerplate code that you might write over-and-over again.  In particular, this project will leverage the [swagger-node](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node) project, which itself uses a web application framework called [expressjs](https://expressjs.com).

* Install NodeJS using [nvm (node version manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).  Windows users can use: [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
* Install [swagger-node](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node)
* Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) or [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/) or [Docker for Linux ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/)

# Step 2: Exploring the project layout

* Learn about the `swagger-node` project
* Learn about the project layout
* `controllers` directory
* `swagger` directory

[item]: # (/slide)

## Exercise

Swagger-node will create a template project, which you can then customize to your needs.  Observe that there is an `api` directory, that contains folders for `controllers`, `helpers`, `mocks`, `swagger`, and others.

For the purposes of this tutorial, let's focus our attention on `controllers` and `swagger`:

* `controllers`: ExpressJS is a Model-View-Controller web framework.  The Controller is basically the business logic for the app, where the View is what you ultimately consume as a web page, and Model defines the objects that would be referenced in your View and Controller.  In short, the Controller is somewhat like the glue between the Model and View.

* `swagger`: This directory holds the `swagger.yaml` file, which provides the definition for your REST API.  We will manipulate this file quite a bit using the Swagger Editor.

## Exercise

* Open another terminal windows or tab
* In the new terminal, change to the project directory

### Terminal 1

```
swagger project start
```

### Terminal 2
```
swagger project edit
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
In the window where you entered the command `swagger project start`, you should see console output:

```
Starting: /Users/<username>/src/rest-api-swagger/app.js...
  project started here: http://localhost:10010/
  project will restart on changes.
  to restart at any time, enter `rs`
try this:
curl http://127.0.0.1:10010/hello?name=Scott

```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

In the window where you entered the command `swagger project edit`, you should see this console output, and your browser should have loaded the editor.

```
Starting Swagger Editor.

# Step 4: Understand the project and development process

* Learn about the basics of a Swagger file
* Learn about YAML
* Learn about `paths` and `definitions` sections

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
![](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node/raw/master/docs/images/overview2.png)
(Source: Swagger-node project)

[item]: # (/slide)

It's important to realize that the Swagger file is the focal point of the process.  You are working in an API-definition-first model, and adding business logic to your code as a result of what you define in the Swagger file.

[item]: # (slide)
## Swagger file details
[item]: # (/slide)

In order to effectively work with the Swagger definition, it's useful to know more about the relevant parts of the file.  If you want to learn about all of the possible options in an OpenAPI specification, you can go [here](http://swagger.io/specification/).  OpenAPI files can be in JSON or [YAML format](http://yaml.org).  The format that we will work in is YAML.  If you're not familiar with YAML, it's a key-value based file format that is easy to read for humans.

Beginning section: Everything stems from the root "Swagger object".  Before defining the methods of your API, the Swagger file can provide some overall information about your API including: The Swagger version, `info`, `host`, `basePath`, `schemes`, `consumes`, and `produces`.

`paths` section: This object describes the REST API paths that your application will expose to the world.

`definitions` section: This object describes the objects that will be sent into your API methods or returned by your API methods.  It is used by the swagger "middleware" to validate what is being provided to and returned from the API.

[item]: # (slide)
![](docs/swagger2.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
# Step 5: Creating a new API

* Learn about the basic elements of adding a path to the Swagger file
* Add a `/restaurants` path to the Swagger file using snippet

[item]: # (/slide)

Notice that there is an existing endpoint called `/hello`, also called a "path object".  It includes an "operation object" , `get`, which contains two fields: `parameters` and `responses`.

[item]: # (slide)
```
paths:
  /hello:
    get:
    		...
    	parameters:
    		...
    	responses:
    		...
```
[item]: # (/slide)

## Exercise

[item]: # (slide)
Let's add a new API.  In the Swagger editor, which should be a tab in your open web browser already, add a new API called `/restaurants`.

![](docs/create-new-api-1.png)
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
Once you have added the `path` named `/restaurants:`, hit RETURN, and then TAB.  

![](docs/create-new-api-2.png)
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
Start typing the word `get`.  You'll noticed that you are presented with an autocomplete option.  Hit TAB to autocomplete the snippet.

![](docs/create-new-api-3.png)
[item]: # (/slide)

This is great, however there are a couple of errors to resolve.

[item]: # (slide)
Add some text to the `summary` and `description` fields.
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
```
  /restaurants:
    get:
      summary: Displays all of the restaurants available
      description: Displays all of the restaurants available.  These restaurants are fantastic.
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
```
[item]: # (/slide)


## Help
If you are stuck, you can use `git checkout -b step5 step5` to reset the project in the right place.

[item]: # (slide)
# Step 6: Wiring up the controller

* Add `x-swagger-router-controller: restaurants`
* Add `operationId: index`
* Add `api/controllers/restaurants.js`
* Add `function index({})` to `restaurants.js`
* Add object definitions to Swagger file

[item]: # (/slide)

At this point, you have an API displaying in the Swagger editor, but it doesn't do anything.  If you use the Swagger editor to try it out, you'll just get an error.

In order for your REST API to do something interesting, you need to wire it to a controller.  The Swagger spec defines an `operationId` field, and the swagger-node project has extended the Swagger spec to also include a reference to the controller via the `x-swagger-router-controller` field.

## Exercise

[item]: # (slide)
Add the following to your Swagger file:

* `x-swagger-router-controller: restaurants`
* `operationId: index`
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
```
paths:
  /restaurants:
    x-swagger-router-controller: restaurants
    get:
      summary: Displays all of the restaurants available
      description: Displays all of the restaurants available.  These restaurants are fantastic.
      operationId: index
      responses:
        200:
          description: An array of restaurants
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
The next step is to create the controller in your project.

In the terminal, and within your project (`rest-api-swagger`), create a file named `restaurants.js` in the path `api/controllers/`.
[item]: # (/slide)

Open `restaurants.js` in a text editor.  Recall that in the Swagger file, there were two fields: `x-swagger-router-controller` and `operationId`.  We've already created the controller file, now we need to complete the `operationId`.  Since the value of the `operationId` corresponds to `index`, we need to add a function called `index` in `restaurants.js`.

[item]: # (slide)
Copy the content below into `restaurants.js`.

```javascript
'use strict'


module.exports = {
    index: index
};

function index(req, res) {

    var restaurants = [
	{
	    name: 'Bar Americano',
	    address: '20 Presgrave Pl, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia'
	},
	{
	    name: 'Ronchi 78',
	    address: 'Via S. Maurilio, 7, 20123 Milano, Italy'
	}
    ];

    res.json(restaurants);
}
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
If you try to execute the API, however, you'll receive an error in your terminal:

```
Error: Response validation failed: void does not allow a value
```

This is because our Swagger file does not include a definition for the resulting object, and so it's rejecting the result.
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
To address this, we must define a schema definition for the restaurants object the `index` is sending back to the server.

```
      responses:
        200:
          description: An array of restaurants
          schema:
            $ref: "#/definitions/Restaurants"
```

```
definitions:
  Restaurants:
    items:
      $ref: "#/definitions/Restaurant"
  Restaurant:
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
      address:
        type: string
```

# Step 7: Deploying into Docker

* Create a `Dockerfile`
* Learn about `docker run`, `docker stop`

[item]: # (/slide)

You may have heard of Docker before.  In general, Docker is a way to run an application on a system in a "container".  This means that you can package all of your application and its dependencies into a logical grouping.  Containers are different from a VM in that they don't include another kernel within the container.  Your application is interacting with the kernel of the computer you are running it on.

[item]: # (slide)
## Exercise

* This exercise assumes you reviewed the prerequisites, and installed the Docker runtime on your workstation.
* In order to package your application and its dependencies into a container, you need to create a `Dockerfile` at the root of the project (e.g., `rest-api-swagger/Dockerfile`).  
* Then, you will "build" the container and "run" the container.
[item]: # (/slide)

A `Dockerfile` has several key components and made up of a series of commands.  It's a bit like a batch script in that sense.  

* First, you need to tell Docker from which image you want to inherit.  This saves you the trouble of having to create all of the dependencies by hand.  To do this, you use the `FROM` statement.
* Then, you will supply a series of additional commands to copy your application and its dependencies into the container.  This will be a combination of `RUN` and `COPY`.
* You will also need to tell Docker in which directory to look for your app.  To do this, you use the `WORKDIR` statement.
* If you want to communicate with your application over a known port, you need to use the `EXPOSE` statement.
* Finally, to run your application (or script), you will use the `CMD` statement.

[item]: # (slide)
### Create a `Dockerfile`

In the root of the project:

```
touch Dockerfile
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
### Copy the following into your own `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM node:5.11.1

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY ./node_modules /usr/src/app/node_modules
COPY ./api /usr/src/app/api
COPY ./config /usr/src/app/config
COPY ./app.js /usr/src/app/

EXPOSE 10010

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```
[item]: # (/slide)

Note that we're using `CMD ["node", "app.js"]` as opposed to `CMD ["swagger", "project", "start"]`.  To run this app in production, it's recommended to use the `node app.js` method to start the app.

[item]: # (slide)
## Building

To actually create the container, you need to `build` the container.  Therefore, you will execute the following command:

```
docker build -t {yourDockerName}/rest-api-swagger:latest .
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
### Example Output:

```
$ docker build -t {yourDockerName}/rest-api-swagger:latest .

```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
## Running

Once you've successfully created the container, now you can (finally) run it! Please note you need to map the port defined in the EXPOSE statement from the Dockerfile, to a port in the host (in this case we will use host port 8080).

```
docker run -p 8080:10010 -d --name swagger-default {yourDockerName}/rest-api-swagger:latest
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
You should be able to view the result by opening `http://localhost:8080/restaurants` in a browser, or running the command `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/restaurants` from a terminal window.

![](docs/docker-success.png)
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
## Stopping

To stop your container, open another terminal window, and execute the `docker stop` command.

```
docker stop swagger-default
```
[item]: # (/slide)

## Help
If you are stuck, you can use `git checkout -b step7 step7` to reset the project in the right place.

[item]: # (slide)
# Step 8: Bonus: Docker Makefile

* Learn about how a `Makefile` provides convenience to dev process
* Learn about `Makefile` variables
* Learn about how to pass environment variables and an environment variable file to the `docker` commands

[item]: # (/slide)

It can be tiresome to remember the `docker` commands and syntax.  Creating a `Makefile`, can help remove some of the typos and mundane activites as you work through a project like this.  With a `Makefile`, you can simply type `make` or `make run` in order to build and run your project, respectively.

## Exercises

Create a new file called `Makefile` in the root of the project directory.

In the `Makefile` contents below, notice that there are a few variables that are set at the top in all caps.  These variable names are mostly taken from the Docker nomenclature for Docker Registries and documentation:

* `NS`: stands for namespace
* `VERSION`: you can set the version of the container that is created or started
* `REPO`: The container repo name
* `NAME`: The shorthand name of the container
* `INSTANCE`: An instance name for the container (not totally necessary, but included for more advanced use cases)
* `PORTS`: The port flag that sets which maps the exposed port to the port on your workstation

** You will need to ensure that you are using TABs in the Makefile for indention **
** Otherwise, you will get errors. **

```
NS = ciscodevnet
VERSION ?= latest

REPO = rest-api-swagger
NAME = swagger
INSTANCE = default
PORTS = -p 8080:10010

.PHONY: build push shell run start stop rm release

build:
	docker build -t $(NS)/$(REPO):$(VERSION) .

push:
	docker push $(NS)/$(REPO):$(VERSION)

shell:
	docker run --rm --name $(NAME)-$(INSTANCE) -i -t $(PORTS) $(VOLUMES) $(ENV) $(NS)/$(REPO):$(VERSION) /bin/bash

run:
	docker run --rm --name $(NAME)-$(INSTANCE) $(LINK) $(PORTS) $(VOLUMES) $(ENV) $(NS)/$(REPO):$(VERSION)

start:
	docker run -d --name $(NAME)-$(INSTANCE) $(PORTS) $(LINK) $(VOLUMES) $(ENV) $(NS)/$(REPO):$(VERSION)

stop:
	docker stop $(NAME)-$(INSTANCE)

rm:
	docker rm $(NAME)-$(INSTANCE)

release: build
	make push -e VERSION=$(VERSION)

default: build

```

The `default` make command is to execute `docker build`.  The difference between `make run` and `make start` is that `make start` will daemonize the container, so that it will be running in the background.  The `make shell` command will execute your container, but drop you into the bash shell.  This is very useful for troubleshooting your container via the command line.  You can execute typical bash commands like `ls -l`, check for the existence of environment variables, or run your app manually.

## Environment Variables

It's possible (and highly recommended if you're following the 12factor app patterns) to pass environment variables into your container when it is loaded.  You can do this with the `-e` flag.  If you find yourself using many environment variables, it is more convenient in your development environment to create a file on your workstation containing all of your environment variables.  The format is quite simple, where you define all of your dev environment variables in the standard key-value format (KEY=variable).  You can then use the `--env-file` flag to pass in your environment variables into the container at runtime (`--env-file=./my-vars`).  In the `Makefile`, you can set the `ENV` variable then to `--env-file=./<yourfile>`.

## Help
If you are stuck, you can use `git checkout -b step8 step8` to reset the project in the right place.

# Part 2: Adding persistence with MongoDB
[item]: # (/slide)

During this section, you will find it useful to have multiple terminal tabs open at once.  You should open three tabs to this project's directory.

# Upgrading The Project

[item]: # (slide)
Duplicate the existing restaurants controller, and name the new file `restaurants.mean.js`.

```
$ cd api/controllers
$ cp restaurants.js restaurants.mean.js
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
In the `app.js`, you need to add the Mongoose ODM (Object Document Mapper) package.

Insert at line 6:

```
// Use the Mongoose ORM for modeling your objects in MongoDB
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Declare the database connection
var db = mongoose.connection;

// If no MONGO environment variable exists, default to localhost
if (!process.env.MONGO) {
  process.env.MONGO = "mongodb://localhost:27017/restaurants";
}

// Connect to the database using the environment variable
// process.env.MONGO
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO);

// Listen for events from Mongoose
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', function() {
  console.log("DB Connected");
});
```
[item]: # (/slide)

If you try to run the project, you'll be faced with an error, `Error: Cannot find module 'mongoose'`.  This is because we have not yet installed the dependency in our project.  To do that, you can use `npm`.  Execute `npm install mongoose --save`.  The `--save` portion of the command will add it to your `package.json`, which enables another user or system do know which dependencies are part of this project.

# Defining A New Route

If not already open, open the Swagger editor: `swagger project edit`.  This will open a browser window for you to manipulate and preview your changes as you move along.

[item]: # (slide)
At Line 32 in the `swagger.yaml`, add a new route.

```
# swagger.yaml
/restaurants-mean:
  x-swagger-router-controller: restaurants.mean
  get:
    summary: Displays all of the restaurants available from Mongo
    description: Displays all of the restaurants available.  These restaurants are fantastic.
    operationId: indexMean
    responses:
      200:
        description: An array of restaurants
        schema:
          $ref: "#/definitions/Restaurants"
```
[item]: # (/slide)

Exploring adjustments to the Swagger above:

* This route definition is similar to the earlier `/restaurants` route, but it has been renamed and points to the new controller file we created earlier, `restaurants.mean.js`, in the `x-swagger-router-controller: restaurants.mean` property.  
* The `operationId: index` is renamed to `operationId: indexMean`

It's also necessary to make some adjustments in the `restaurants.mean.js` controller:

[item]: # (slide)
```
// restaurants.mean.js

...

module.exports = {
    indexMean: indexMean
};

function indexMean(req, res) {

...
```
[item]: # (/slide)

* The `module.exports` object contents have been updated to reflect the new `indexMean` function name.
* `function indexMean(req, req)` now corresponds to our definition in the Swagger file.

## Help
If you are stuck, you can use `git checkout -b step9 step9` to reset the project in the right place.

# Download and Run MongoDB

[item]: # (slide)
Run the project (`swagger project start`).  You will see an error.  That's because we don't have a MongoDB up and running.

```

There are many options for running an instance of MongoDB.  In this tutorial, we're going to run Mongo inside a Docker container.

To download the [Mongo container](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/), use the Docker CLI.  First go to one of the other tabs in your terminal.

[item]: # (slide)
```
$ docker pull mongo
```

To run the container we just pulled, and run it in daemon mode (`-d`):

```
$ docker run --name restaurants -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
```

[item]: # (/slide)

You can check to see if the container is running by typing:

`$ docker ps`

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
b08274879bdc        mongo               "/entrypoint.sh mo..."   3 days ago          Up 3 days           0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp   restaurants
```

In the same terminal tab, start the project:

[item]: # (slide)
```
$ cd rest-api-swagger
$ swagger project start
Starting: /Users/ashleyroach/src/rest-api-swagger/app.js...
  project started here: http://localhost:10010/
  project will restart on changes.
  to restart at any time, enter `rs`
DB Connected
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
Using the Swagger Editor already open in your browser, locate the `GET /restaurants-mean` path, and click on the "Try Operation" button followed by "Send Request".

You should see the result:

```
[{"name":"Bar Americano","address":"20 Presgrave Pl, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia"},{"name":"Ronchi 78","address":"Via S. Maurilio, 7, 20123 Milano, Italy"}]
```
[item]: # (/slide)

At this point, the app is functional, connecting to the database, but because we copied our original file as a starting point, the app is not yet using the database.  To start leveraging the database, we need to write some code using the Mongoose package we installed earlier.

[item]: # (slide)
# Wiring Up Mongoose
[item]: # (/slide)

Mongoose requires that you define a `model` of your data (aka documents) that will be stored in MongoDB.  Create the file `api/controllers/restaurants.model.js`.  

[item]: # (slide)
```
$ touch api/controllers/restaurants.model.js
```
[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)
Insert the following into that file:

```
'use strict';

var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var RestaurantSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
  	type: String,
  	required: true
  },
  address: {
  	type: String,
  	required: true
  }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Restaurant', RestaurantSchema);
```
[item]: # (/slide)

* This code defines a `Schema` that Mongoose will use to move data in and out of your database.
* The `new Schema()` block defines the elements needed to tell Mongoose what it should expect when a `Restaurant` object is sent to it.

[item]: # (slide)
We have to refactor the `restaurants.mean.js` controller to interact with MongoDB.

Import the model near the top of the file (Line 3):

```
var Restaurants = require('./restaurants.model');
```

Replace the contents of the `indexMean` function with the following:

```
Restaurants.find(function (err, contents) {
  if(err) { return handleError(res, err); }
  return res.status(200).json(contents);
});
```
[item]: # (/slide)

Explaining the code:

* `Restaurants.find()` is a function that is inherited when you create a Mongoose schema and model.  When it executes, it will return either an error (`err`) or the data (`contents`) to the function.
* If there is no error, the data is returned in the response using a HTTP code of 200, and formatting the content as JSON.


With the Swagger Editor running navigate on the page to the `GET /restaurants-mean` endpoint.  Click on the "Try this operation" button.  Scroll down and click on the "Send Request" button, the app will return an empty array (e.g., `[]`).

## Help
If you are stuck, you can use `git checkout -b step10 step10` to reset the project in the right place.

[item]: # (slide)
# Adding Data Into The Database
[item]: # (/slide)

To initially seed the database, we can create a script that will load upon startup and insert some dummy data into MongoDB.  But, better yet, let's update the `/restaurants-mean` endpoint to accept the HTTP method `POST`.  

If it's not already open, open the Swagger editor (`swagger project edit`).

Currently, the `/restaurants-mean` endpoint only supports `GET`.  To add a `POST` method, at Line 43, insert `post:` by starting to type `post` and entering `TAB` on your keyboard to execute the snippet.  

```
post:
  summary:
  description:
  responses:
    200:
      description: OK
```

Add a summary and description:

```
summary: Create a new restaurant entry
description: Create a new restaurant entry
```

Turning to the `responses` section, when you create a new record via REST, the API should return a `201` HTTP code.  Update the existing `200` code to be `201`.

```
post:
  summary:
  description:
  responses:
    201:
      description: OK
```

To complete the `post:` method in the Swagger definition file, it's necessary to provide the `operationId` and the `parameters` that will be submitted to the API.

[item]: # (slide)
```
post:
  summary: Create a new restaurant entry
  description: Create a new restaurant entry
  operationId: createMean
  parameters:
    - name: restaurant
      in: body
      required: true
      description: Restaurant Object
      schema:
        $ref: "#/definitions/Restaurant"         
  responses:
    201:
      description: OK
      schema:
        $ref: "#/definitions/Restaurant"
```
[item]: # (/slide)

* The `operationId` maps to the the function definition in the controller (`createMean`).
* To tell the Swagger system what data to expect, we define a `parameters` block that contains `in: body` -- meaning that the object will be submitted in the body of the request -- and the `schema` is defined as the `Restaurant` object we defined earlier in this project.

Next, we'll implement the `createMean` method in the controller.

[item]: # (slide)
Add a new function in the controller.

```
module.exports = {
    indexMean: indexMean,
    createMean: createMean
};

...

// Around Line 19

function createMean(req, res) {

  var newRestaurant = {
    name: req.body.name,
    address: req.body.address
  }

  Restaurants.create(newRestaurant, function(err, content) {
    if(err) { return handleError(res, err); }
    // console.log(content);
    return res.status(201).json(content);
  });
}
```
[item]: # (/slide)

Exploring the code above:

* To expose the `createMean()` function, JavaScript requires that you export the name.  Therefore, you must add the `createMean: createMean` line to the `module.exports` object.

* A new function is defined called `createMean(req, res)`.  The function expects a request object `req`, and returns a response object `res`.  These objects are provided by the Express framework inherited by the swagger-node project.

* MongoDB is a no-SQL database, and stores JSON objects as the records within the database.  A `newRestaurant` JSON object is created by assigning the `req.body.name` and `req.body.address`.  This object will be passed into the Mongoose `create()` function.

* By declaring the `Restaurants` object as a new Mongoose `Schema`, the database operations are inherited as part of the `Restaurants` object.

* If no error is raised by Mongoose, the `return` statement returns an HTTP code of `201` and also returns the Mongo result via the `content` variable.  The `content` variable is the result of a JavaScript callback, which is a common pattern for asynchronous operations in JavaScript / NodeJS.

Using the Swagger Editor, locate the `POST /restaurants-mean` section, click on the "Try Operation" button, fill in the `name` and `address` details, and click on "Send Request".

You should receive a result that resembles:

```
{
  "__v": 0,
  "name": "Bar Americano",
  "address": "20 Presgrave Pl, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",
  "_id": "5881f4011d90cd17c326f78f"
}
```

Locate the `GET /restaurants` section in the Swagger Editor.  Click on "Try Operation".  The result is the JSON document that is stored in your MongoDB.

```
[
  {
    "_id": "5881f4011d90cd17c326f78f",
    "name": "Bar Americano",
    "address": "20 Presgrave Pl, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",
    "__v": 0
  }
]
```

## Help
If you are stuck, you can use `git checkout -b step11 step11` to reset the project in the right place.

# Summary

In Part 1, we created a basic REST API using the swagger-node project.  We also packaged it as a container and learned about using a Makefile to make our lives easier when dealing with the Docker CLI.

In Part 2, our basic project expanded to include the ability to persist data that is submitted to the REST API.  We used MongoDB as the database and Mongoose to connect from our swagger-node project.
