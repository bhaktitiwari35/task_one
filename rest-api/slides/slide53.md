Run the project (`swagger project start`).  You will see an error.  That's because we don't have a MongoDB up and running.

```
connection error: { [MongoError: failed to connect to server [localhost:27071] on first connect]
  name: 'MongoError',
  message: 'failed to connect to server [localhost:27071] on first connect' }
```
