## Exercise

* This exercise assumes you reviewed the prerequisites, and installed the Docker runtime on your workstation.
* In order to package your application and its dependencies into a container, you need to create a `Dockerfile` at the root of the project (e.g., `rest-api-swagger/Dockerfile`).  
* Then, you will "build" the container and "run" the container.
